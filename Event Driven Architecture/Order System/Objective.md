Here is a problem statement for a project that i need to complete and learn from. This is the very first time i will ever be implementing this kind of project. Help me step by step in solving the problem helping me to learn
Let me suggest a practical project that would help you learn event-driven architecture using mediator topology with real-world applicability: an E-commerce Order Processing System.
This project is perfect because:
1. It has clear event flows
2. Multiple services need to communicate
3. It's similar to real-world business requirements
4. You can incrementally add complexity
Here's the project blueprint:
Project: E-commerce Order Processing System
Core Features:

1. Order Placement → Inventory Check → Payment Processing → Order Fulfillment
2. Real-time order status updates
3. Customer notification system
4. Inventory management
5. Basic analytics

Here's how you could structure it:
1. Events:
python
# Main events you'll handle
ORDER_EVENTS = [
    'order.created',
    'payment.processed',
    'inventory.checked',
    'order.confirmed',
    'shipping.initiated',
    'order.delivered'
]

2. Services:
python
# Core services to implement
- OrderService (FastAPI)
- PaymentService (FastAPI)
- InventoryService (FastAPI)
- NotificationService (FastAPI)
- AnalyticsService (FastAPI)

3. Tech Stack:
python
- Apache Kafka for event streaming
- PostgreSQL for service databases
- Redis for caching
- Celery for background tasks
- FastAPI for service APIs
- Docker for containerization

Basic Implementation Flow:
python
# When an order is placed:
1. OrderService creates order → Emits 'order.created'
2. InventoryService checks stock → Emits 'inventory.checked'
3. PaymentService processes payment → Emits 'payment.processed'
4. OrderService confirms order → Emits 'order.confirmed'
5. NotificationService sends updates to customer
6. AnalyticsService records all events for reporting

Learning Progression:
1. Phase 1 - Basic Setup:
   - Set up basic services with FastAPI
   - Implement Kafka producers/consumers
   - Basic order flow
2. Phase 2 - Reliability:
   - Add error handling
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Add logging and monitoring
3. Phase 3 - Scale:
   - Containerize services with Docker
   - Add caching with Redis
   - Implement background tasks with Celery
4. Phase 4 - Features:
   - Add real-time order tracking
   - Implement analytics dashboard
   - Add email notifications
Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect or provide more detailed code examples for any of these components?
This project would give you hands-on experience with:
- Event-driven architecture
- Microservices communication
- Message queues
- Async programming
- Real-time processing
- Distributed systems
Here is some additional detail that i want you to remember I want to use kafka through docker running using kraft and not zookeeper here.
